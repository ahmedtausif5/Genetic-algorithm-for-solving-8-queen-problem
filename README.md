# Genetic-algorithm-for-solving-8-queen-problem

1. I have made the code in such a way that the final answer returns:
  • the configuration of the final layout with zero attacking pairs
  • the total number of iteration required to get to the final layout with zero attacking pairs
  • the total fitness of the final layout, to confirm that the layout has zero attacking pairs (if 
fitness==28, number of attacking pairs==0)

2. The final layout has values ranging from 1-8, with 1 corresponding to the first row (row 1), and 8 
corresponding to the last row (row 8)

3. The population is randomly generated every time the code is run. So, sometimes it takes a few 
minutes to come to a configuration with zero attacking pairs. Please do not stop/interrupt the 
code while it is running, and wait a few minutes
